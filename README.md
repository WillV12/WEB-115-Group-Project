    * What is a Fuorier Transform?:
        - A fuorier transform allows an individual to find what frequencies make up a combined and more complex signal
        - The top plot is this combined signal
        - The next three plots are the frequencies the user inputed
        - The first desmos plot is the combined signal wrapped around a circle in a complex plane
        - The bottom plot is the integral of this plot (giving us a average of all points of the first desmos plot)
        - The peaks of this plot are the frequencies that the user inputted
